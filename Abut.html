    <h2>About Itszu Bakery</h2>

    <h3>Our Story</h3>
    <p>Itszu Bakery began as a small dream — a cozy kitchen, a curious heart, and a deep love for baking. What started as a hobby of crafting sweet treats for friends and family turned into a passion for spreading joy through food. With each brownie baked and cake carefully decorated, our goal has always been the same: to create simple moments of happiness in every bite.</p>

    <h3>What Makes Us Special</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>🍫 Handmade in small batches for quality and freshness</li>
      <li>🎁 Perfect for gifts, events, or a little self-love</li>
      <li>💜 Custom orders available — because every customer is unique</li>
      <li>🌱 We use only the best ingredients, with love in every layer</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Meet the Baker</h3>
    <p>Hi! I'm Izzu — the heart behind Itszu Bakery. I'm a student, a self-taught baker, and a person who finds peace in mixing butter and sugar together. I believe baking is both a science and an art, and I love exploring new flavors, perfecting classics, and turning everyday cravings into special treats.</p>

    <h3>Our Mission</h3>
    <p>To bring a little more warmth, sweetness, and human connection into the world through humble homemade desserts. Whether it's a brownie shared between friends or a cake that lights up a birthday, we want to be part of your special moments.</p>

    <p class="thank-you">Thank you for supporting our small business. Every order means the world to us. 💕</p>
